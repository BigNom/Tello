      <Paragraph size="large">
        Many nights, after work, my partner and I like to watch an hour or two of trashy reality TV. It's a great way to unwind after a long day.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph size="large">
        I noticed that I was really bad at remembering things; I couldn't remember which episodes we had already seen. Worse, I'd totally forget about some great series once I had finished the current season; years later, maybe I'd remember to check for new seasons, but I'm sure I forgot about a ton of great shows.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph size="large">
        I tried some of the existing options but found that they were bloated and overcomplicated. I wanted a quick way to check what shows were available for me to watch, and nothing I found did the trick.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph size="large">
        As a software developer and semi-competent designer, I realized that this was a problem I could solve, and Tello was built! <Emoji>âœ¨</Emoji>
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph size="large">
        This is very much a side-project. It was built mostly during a week-long vacation (as well as a few evenings/weekends). The scope is very narrow, because it had to be, but that also means it's very focused at doing 1 thing, and doing it well: letting you know what to watch right before you sit down in front of a TV.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph size="large">
        The goal of Tello is not to become a business, or to make money. It's something I wanted to exist, and a good excuse to practice my design/dev skills. On the extremely unlikely chance that Tello becomes popular, I may need to do some monetization to cover its costs... Most likely I'd charge a small fee for membership to <em>new</em> members, but I'd like to keep it free for early adopters. But yeah, that's unlikely.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph size="large">
        I hope you enjoy Tello! If it helps, please <Link to="/contact">reach out and let me know</Link>!
